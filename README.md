## ℹ️ Description
My implementation of the Chip-8 interpreter in Rust, that allows ROM emulation of programs designed for the Chip-8 system.
I made this just for fun and to learn Rust.

I used `glow` and `Imgui` to display the pixels and UI, as well as `SDL2` to handle the window, input and sound.

It is also quite customizable, as you can change the color palette, the emulation _"quirks"_ and screen timings.
